 <h1>TOP KDRAMAS ACCORDING TO ANSHU</h1>
 <h2>TOP THREE KDRAMAS OF ALL TIME</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>QUEEN OF TEARS</h3>
<p>It's after a long time I actually liked a romantic Kdrama.<br /> This was funny, emotional, intense and at the same time stupid.<br /> The story  is a gem<br /> The one thing which saved this show and made me rate it so high was the acting, an absolute delight.<br /> It reminded me of the emotional intensity when I first watched CLOY, which I'm grateful that I could feel it again.<br /> I actually sobbed again which is a testament to how good some scenes actually are</p>
<h3>GLORY</h3>
<p>Great watch.<br /> I honestly did not feel bored when watching this because I was constantly trying to connect all the points and draw the whole map in my head</p>
<h3>TOMMOROW</h3>
<p>This drama is very particular since it deals with death and sensitive issues like suicide.<br /> Chapter 6 is so moving and touching, i loved a lot. <br />First two episodes were kind of shoking beacuse there is a lot of suffering and disturbing events.<br /> But that is life though. <br /> So, I think that the stories are good to reflect on, but it is hard to watch and definetly not for someone who is dealing with depression and suicidal thoughs</p>
